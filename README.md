# Lefty_Lemurs

This repository contains the datasets and data analysis for my research project I created as a summer 2022 field research intern at the Duke Lemur Center

I uploaded both my original and clean dataset, as well as my data analysis file.

If you click on the "Wiki" tab on the GitHub page, you can see the behind-the-scenes of my study, and see pictures of the lemurs!

Feel free to look around :-)
