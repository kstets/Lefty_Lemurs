#Here's what I did to clean the data

#Importing dataset
L_PreClean <- read.csv("~/Documents/GitHub/Lefty_Lemurs/LeftyLemurs_Original.csv")

#rename long column names to simpler ones
L_PreClean <- rename(L_PreClean, Troop = Troop.............A..B..C..D...., Time = Time..H.M.S., Note = Focal.sample.note......................................................................................................................................................please.include.as.much.detail.as.possible...If.a.note.is.about.a.grooming.bout..for.example..include.stop.time.in.the.same.cell.)


# remove commas in the category column
L_PreClean$Category <- str_replace(L_PreClean$Category, ",", "")

# Why on earth did it make it into a value instead of a new data frame??? I guess it doesn't matter because it still works...
# Sometimes I wrote behaviors in all caps, and sometimes I didn't. I'm just going to put all of them in all caps because it's easier.

L_PreClean$Category = toupper(L_PreClean$Category)

#I have some data where I didn't actually record the limb used. Why did I do that? I'm going to delete the rows where I forgot to list the limb.

#Only keep rows in categories that don't contain RH, LH, RF, and/or LF
L_HFdata <-
  L_PreClean %>%
  filter(str_detect(Category, "RH|RF|LH|LF"))

# Squeaky clean

# Now I want to create a separate data frame that only contains behaviors from my ethogram:


# do not run!! <- note from future me
# lefty_justEthogram <-
# L %>%  select(Category) %>%
# filter(str_detect(Category, "BP|QP|L|AG|SG|F|E|CL|HC|R|G|"))


# Why didn't it work

# This did not work: Would it be possible to split the "Category" column into 2 columns? 1 that says "Task" and another that says "Limb"?

# "Limb" would have LH/RH/LF/RH and "Task" would have the other stuff

# I think if I duplicate the column and rename it and then eliminate the limbs from "Task" and keep only the limbs in "Limbs" it might work.

# Then I can rename the tasks to "Eating/Grooming/Locomotion/etc.

# Duplicating "Category" and calling the new one "Limb"


# do not run: L_HFdata$Limb <- L_PreClean$Category
# do not run: L_PreClean2 <- L_PreClean %>% relocate (Limb, .before = Note)


# *This did not work*

# Replacing limb with nothing

# do not run: lefty_split <- L_PreClean2$Category <- str_replace(L_PreClean$Limb, "BP|QP|L|AG|SG|F|E|CL|HC|R|G|", "")

# do not run: lefty_fullsplit <- L_PreClean2$Limb <- str_replace(L_PreClean$Category, "LF|LH|RF|RH|", "")

# Categories kept limbs because they include an R (like rest) or L (like locomotion) I think limb section stayed the same? I think it kept all the columns that contained the limbs, which was all of them ofc. I might be running the wrong code.

# Okay I'm going to use find and replace in Excel to fix it because R doesn't know how to do anything apparently and I literally want to cry rn

# Wait wtf why does it say 30,000+ rows columns

## okay I've spent 4 hours trying to get it to work and tbh this is a waste of time so I'm just going to export the behavior data as a CSV and finish cleaning it in Google Sheets

# Writing as CSV bc my attempts at making limb column completely failed after working on it for 2 days

write_csv(L_PreClean,"Lefty_Lemurs.csv")


# **Here's what I did in Google Sheets with the CSV file** (I really wanted to do it in R but I could not figure it out and wasted hours and hours)

- # Deleted rows that didn't contain behaviors from my ethogram
- # Copied "Category" into 2 columns
- # In old Category column, deleted limb data
- #  In new "Limb" data, kept only limb data (not behavior)
- # Deleted rows that had question marks in data
- # Deleted data where category was "Other"
- #  Deleted data that had rows with both hands
- #  Merged "F" and "E" into one category "E"
- #  Looked through notes to change category when it was just "G". Most got changed to L, some got changed to R, a few got deleted
- #  Added new column for H/F to say whether limb was hand or foot
- #  Added new column for side to say whether limb was left or right

# New categories - E (eating/foraging) - R (resting) (lemur is still) - L (locomotion) (active motion like leaping, climbing, or jumping) - CL (cross legs) - HC (hand clasp) - BP (bipedal walking) - QP (quadrupedal walking) - LA (land) - SG (self grooming) - AG (allo-grooming)
